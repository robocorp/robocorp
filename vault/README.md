# robocorp-vault

`robocorp-vault` is a library that provides read and write access to the
[Vault](https://robocorp.com/docs/development-guide/variables-and-secrets/vault)
in Robocorp Control Room, which can be used to store and retrieve secret values such as passwords.

## Getting started

A secret consists of a name, an optional description, and a map of
keys and values. For instance, one secret can be login credentials for a website,
which includes both a username and a password:

```python
from robocorp.tasks import task
from robocorp import vault

@task
def inspect_secret():
    secret = vault.get_secret("login_credentials")
    print("Secret name:", secret.name)
    print("Secret description:", secret.description)
    print("Secret keys:", secret.keys())
    print("Secret value:", secret["username"])
```
