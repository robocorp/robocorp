# It's possible to customize what's logged or not through log filter rules.
#
# Note: by default all files which are in the python "Lib" or "site-packages"
# are considered "library" files and all files which are
# not "library" files are considered "project" files (so, the
# logging by default will show entries for any method that is in the project
# and no logging for methods which are "libraries").
#
# It's possible to customize this behaviour by adding log filter rules.
#
# A log filter rule consists of the module name and the kind of the rule to
# be applied to such module.
#
# i.e.: a rule such as {name = "difflib", kind = "log_on_project_call"} would add
# logging to the difflib and a rule such as {name = "my.sub.module", kind = "exclude"}
# would exclude logging from the given user module.
#
# Log filter rule kinds are:
#
# "log_on_project_call": 
#     In this case methods of the given module will be tracked, only if 
#     the caller was a file considered a project file.
#
#     Example:
#        {name = "RPA", kind = "log_on_project_call"}
#
#        would track methods for RPA as well as RPA.Excel, etc. when
#        such a method is called directly from a file considered part
#        of the project.
#        
#        note: if a library is "repackaged" (meaning that some of its
#        methods are imports from other modules, the filtering must
#        be applied to the actual location and not to the alias).
#
# "full_log"
#     In this case all methods of the given module will be tracked.
#     (default for all files considered project files).
#
# "exclude"
#     In this case all methods of the given module will not be tracked.
#     (default for all files considered library files).
