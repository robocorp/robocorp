"""Main entry point for running tasks from robocorp-tasks.

Note that it's usually preferable to use `robocorp-tasks` as a command line
tool, using it programmatically through the main(args) in this module is also
possible.

Note: when running tasks, clients using this approach MUST make sure that any
code which must be automatically logged is not imported prior the the `cli.main`
call.
