# module `robocorp.tasks.cli`

**Source:** [`cli.py:0`](https://github.com/robocorp/robocorp/tree/master/tasks/src/robocorp/tasks/cli.py#L0)

Main entry point for running tasks from robocorp-tasks.

Note that it's usually preferable to use `robocorp-tasks` as a command line tool, using it programmatically through the main(args) in this module is also possible.

Note: when running tasks, clients using this approach MUST make sure that any code which must be automatically logged is not imported prior the the `cli.main` call.
