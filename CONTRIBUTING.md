# Contributing

This is a contribution guide for the `robocorp` project and associated libraries.

## Library Development

### Prerequisites

The tool used for Python dependency management is `poetry`. Both Python (>=3.9) and
Poetry should be available in either the global environment or in an activated
Conda environment.

It can be installed via pip:

```
pip install poetry
```

### Development

To start working on a library, you need to install the project's development-time
dependencies. This can be done by navigating to the library's folder and running:

```
poetry install
```

After installation, the environment will have `invoke`, which is used for running
different project management tasks defined in `tasks.py` (and `devutils`).

To see all available tasks, run `invoke --list` or `inv -l` for short:

```
poetry run invoke --list
```

For instance, static analysis can be run with:

```
poetry run inv lint
```

**Note:** If you're using a virtual environment already, `invoke` and all other dependencies
should be installed in it directly, and it is not necessary to prefix everything with
`poetry run`. Another option is to use `poetry shell` to get a subshell with the
project's environment.

### Releasing

To make a new release from a library, ensure the following things are done:

1. Documentation has been updated by running `invoke docs` and committing the generated files.
2. The version has been updated according to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
   This can be done by running `invoke set-version <version>`, which modifies all related
   files with the new version number.
3. A new changelog entry is added to `<library>/docs/CHANGELOG.md` that describes the changes.
4. All changed code is pushed to `master` and the test workflows in GitHub Actions are passing.

To trigger a release, a commit should be tagged with the name and version of the library.
The tag can be generated automatically with `invoke make-release`. After the tag has been pushed,
a corresponding GitHub Actions workflow will be triggered that builds the library and publishes
it to PyPI.

### Metapackage

In the `meta` folder is a metapackage for the core features of the `robocorp` framework,
i.e. logging, tasks, and Control Room libraries. It is used in templates and examples
as an easy way to get the main features into a project.

The package is available in PyPI as [robocorp](https://pypi.org/project/robocorp/).

After a new release has been made to one of the contained libraries, the metapackage
should be updated with the correct dependencies. To see if the current configuration
matches what is availale in PyPI, run the following:

```
invoke outdated
```

If it warns about outdated packages, they can be updated with:

```
invoke update
```

The update task also automatically bumps the version of the metapackage based
on the changed versions of the dependencies. Releasing it, is done similarly
to other libraries with `invoke make-release`.
