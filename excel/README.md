# robocorp-excel

This library provides a simple way to deal with both legacy `.xls` files and newer `.xlsx` files directly. It can be used to read and edit them directly without having Microsoft Excel installed.

## Usage

> ðŸ‘‰ Check that you have added the dependency in your configuration; this library is not part of the [**robocorp**](https://pypi.org/project/robocorp/) bundle.
> - _conda.yaml_ for automation [Task Packages](https://robocorp.com/docs/robot-structure)

> âš  `robocorp-excel` is not yet production ready.  
> We work in SemVer, so consider versions below `1.0.0` as development phase releases. You can use them, but to get to **v1**, we need to get the feature support and testing to a level where we feel comfortable recommending this library for production usage.

```python
from robocorp import excel
from robocorp.tasks import task

@task
def inspect_workbook():
    workbook = excel.open_workbook("orders.xlsx")
    worksheet = workbook.worksheet("Sheet1")

    for row in worksheet.as_table(header=True):
        print(row)
```
