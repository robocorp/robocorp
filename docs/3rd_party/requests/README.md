# Requests

The `requests` library is one of the most known and used Python libraries for HTTP calls.

ðŸ‘‰ Their slogan tells it all: _**HTTP for Humans**_

Whether you need to download a file, interact with an API or simply checking if a website is responding, for everything
HTTP, you should just use `requests`.

## Usage

```python
import requests

def download_file(url: str, filename: str) -> str:
    """ 
    Download a file from the given url. 
    """
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    with open(filename, 'wb') as stream:
        stream.write(response.content)
    return filename
```

> AI/LLM's are quite good with `requests`.<br/>
