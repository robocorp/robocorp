# Recommended 3rd-party libraries

The libraries we collect here are some of the most used in the Python ecosystem and automation in general.
We collect enough documentation here so that human and LLM "users" can find the original documentation and sources.
For some libraries, we can also provide basic helper snippets, and in case we get enough requests, or the snippets get
bigger, we will consider creating fully-fledged wrapper libraries.
