SPEC = """ 
# Each message should use a single line in the log output where the prefix
# is the message type and the arguments is either a message with ids/numbers
# separated by '|' or json-encoded strings.
#
# Note that each output log file (even if splitted after the main one) should be
# readable in a completely independent way, so, the starting scope should be
# replicated as well as the needed names to memorize.
#
# To keep the format compact, some strings and locations are referenced through ids. 
# 
# In the spec 'oid' are used to reference a message memorized with 'M' and 
# 'loc_id' or 'loc_and_doc_id' a message memorized with 'P'.
#
# There's an initial time and other time references are time-deltas from this time.
#
# The spec for the messages is below:
#

# Version of the log output
# Example: 'V 0.0.1' - Identifies version 1 of the log
V: version:str

# Some information message
# Example: 'I "python=3.7"'
I: info:json.loads

# The log has an id that may be split into multiple parts.
# 'ID: 1|36ac1f85-6d32-45b0-8ebf-3bbf8d7482f2'     1st part with identifier 36ac1f85-6d32-45b0-8ebf-3bbf8d7482f2.
# 'ID: 2|36ac1f85-6d32-45b0-8ebf-3bbf8d7482f2'     2nd part with identifier 36ac1f85-6d32-45b0-8ebf-3bbf8d7482f2.
ID: part:int, id:str

# Initial time in UTC (all others are based on a delta from this date).
# Example: 'T 2022-10-03T11:30:54.927+00:00'
T: time:dateisoformat

# Memorize some word (to be used as oid).
# i.e.: when the message is something as 'M a:"Start"', we memorize "Start" with key: "a"
# Example: 'M a:"Start"'
M: memorize

# Memorize a path location (name/libname/source/lineno/docstring) to be referenced as loc_id or loc_and_doc_id.
# Note: loc_id and loc_and_doc_id use the same info but one unpacks the docstring and the other doesn't
# Example: 'P a|b|c|d|e' (where those are references to strings memoized with 'M').
P: memorize_path

# Log (raw text)
# level_enum is:
# - ERROR = 'E'
# - FAIL = 'F'
# - INFO = 'I'
# - WARN = 'W'

# Example:
#
# 'L E|a|b|0.123'

# A message which is intended to be sent to to the console
# This can be either a message being sent by the user to stdout/stderr
# (if those are being redirected) or some message from the framework
# intended to be shown in the console.

# Expected "kind" values:
#
# User messages:
# "stdout": Some user message which was being sent to the stdout.
# "stderr": Some user message which was being sent to the stderr.
#
# Messages from the framework:
# "regular": Some regular message.
# "important": Some message which deserves a bit more attention.
# "task_name": The task name is being written.
# "error": Some error message.
# "traceback": Some traceback message.

# 'C a|b|0.123'

# Should be sent when some element we're tracking such as method, for, while, etc. starts.

# (very close to a traceback but the kind is different and the message is not
# the exception message but contains information on the thread dumped).
