Only used if `locator` is passed.

- <b>`wait_time`</b>:  The time to wait after middle-clicking the element. If not passed the default value found in the config is used.

**Example:**

Middle-click using a locator:

```

Click customizing wait time after the middle-click:

```python
from robocorp import windows
calculator_window = windows.find_window('Calculator')
calculator_window.find('name:SendButton').middle_click(wait_time=5.0)
```

Make an existing window foreground so that it can be middle-clicked:

```python
window.foreground_window()
window.middle_click('name:SendButton', wait_time=5.0)
```

**Returns:**
The clicked element.

**Note:**

> The element clicked must be visible in the screen, if it's hidden by some other window or control the middle-click will not work.

**Raises:**

- <b>`ActionNotPossible`</b>:  if element does not allow the middle-click action.

### `print_tree`

Print a tree of control elements.

A Windows application structure can contain multilevel element structure. Understanding this structure is crucial for creating locators. (based on controls' details and their parent-child relationship)

This method can be used to output logs of application's element structure.

The printed element attributes correspond to the values that may be used to create a locator to find the actual wanted element.

**Args:**

- <b>`stream`</b>:  The stream to which the text should be printed (if not given, sys.stdout is used).

- <b>`show_properties`</b>:  Whether the properties of each element should be printed (off by default as it can be considerably slower and makes the output very verbose).

- <b>`max_depth`</b>:  Up to which depth the tree should be printed.

**Example:**

Print the top-level window elements:

```python
from robocorp import windows
windows.desktop().print_tree()
```

**Example:**

Print the tree starting at some other element:

```python
from robocorp import windows
windows.find("Calculator > path:2|3").print_tree()
```

[**Link to source**](https://github.com/robocorp/robocorp/tree/master/windows/src/robocorp/windows/_control_element.py#L665)

```python
print_tree(
    stream=None,
    show_properties: bool = False,
    max_depth: int = 8
) → None

```

**Example:**

```python
# Set value to "ab c"
window.set_value('ab c', locator='type:DataItem name:column1')

# Press ENTER after setting the value.
window.set_value('console.txt', locator='type:Edit name:"File name:"', enter=True)

# Add newline (manually) at the end of the string.
element = window.find('name:"Text Editor"')

## Methods

______________________________________________________________________

### `close_windows`

Closes the windows matching the given locator.

Note that by default the process tree will be force-killed by using the `pid` associated to the window. `use_close_button` can be set to True to try to close it by clicking on the close button (in this case any confirmation dialog must be explicitly handled).

**Args:**

- <b>`locator`</b>:  The locator which should be used to find windows to be closed.

- <b>`search_depth`</b>:  The search depth to be used to find windows (by default equals 1, meaning that only top-level windows will be closed). Note that windows are closed by force-killing the pid related to the window.

- <b>`timeout`</b>:  The search for a window with the given locator will be retried until the given timeout (in **seconds**) elapses. At least one full search up to the given depth will always be done and the timeout will only take place afterwards (if `wait_for_window` is True). Only used if `wait_for_window` is True. If not given the global config timeout will be used.

- <b>`wait_for_window`</b>:  If True windows this method will keep searching for windows until a window is found or until the timeout is reached (an ElementNotFound is raised if no window was found until the timeout is reached, otherwise an empty list is returned).

- <b>`wait_time`</b>:  A time to wait after closing each window.

- <b>`use_close_button`</b>:  If True tries to close the window by searching for a button with the locator: 'control:ButtonControl name:Close' and clicking on it (in this case any confirmation dialog must be explicitly handled).

- <b>`close_button_locator`</b>:  Only used if `use_close_button` is True. This is the locator to be used to find the close button.

**Returns:**
The number of closed windows.

**Raises:**

- <b>`ElementNotFound`</b>:  if wait_for_window is True and the timeout was reached.

### `print_tree`

Print a tree of control elements.

A Windows application structure can contain multilevel element structure. Understanding this structure is crucial for creating locators. (based on controls' details and their parent-child relationship)

This keyword can be used to output logs of application's element structure.

The printed element attributes correspond to the values that may be used to create a locator to find the actual wanted element.

**Args:**

- <b>`stream`</b>:  The stream to which the text should be printed (if not given, sys.stdout is used).

- <b>`show_properties`</b>:  Whether the properties of each element should be printed (off by default as it can be considerably slower and makes the output very verbose).

- <b>`max_depth`</b>:  Up to which depth the tree should be printed.

**Example:**

Print the top-level window elements:

```python
from robocorp import windows
windows.desktop().print_tree()
```

**Example:**

Print the tree starting at some other element:

```python
from robocorp import windows
windows.find_window("Calculator").find("path:2|3").print_tree()
```

[**Link to source**](https://github.com/robocorp/robocorp/tree/master/windows/src/robocorp/windows/_desktop.py#L44)
