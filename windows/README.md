`robocorp-windows` is a library which can be used for Windows desktop automation.

The basic idea of the library is enabling windows and controls to be found
by leveraging `locators` (i.e.: strings which identify how to reach some
window or control) and then interacting with such elements.

There are 3 basic abstractions in the library:

- `Desktop`: enables finding `WindowElement`s and interacting directly with the 
  desktop (so, actions which aren't tied to a Window or Control can be used directly
  through the `Desktop`).
- `WindowElement`: enables finding `ControlElement`s and interacting with a Window.
- `ControlElement`: enables finding child `ControlElement`s and interacting with a specific Control.

Note: these classes are always created by the library itself and are not expected
to be subclassed or instanced directly.

> - _action-package.yaml_ for an automation Action Packages
> - _requirements.txt_, _pyproject.toml_ etc. for the rest


The library concepts revolve around the idea that the window of interest will be 
initially found using `find_window` and then, with that window reference, other
controls can be queried and interacted with (for clicking, entering text, etc).

Below is an example using the windows calculator:

```python
from robocorp import windows

# Get the calculator window
calc = windows.find_window("name:Calculator")

# Press button 0 (the locator is dependent on the windows version).
button0 = calc.find('(name:Zero or name:0) and class:Button')
button0.click()

# Clear the calculator (the locator is dependent on the windows version).
calc.click("id:clearButton or name:Clear")

# Send the keys directly to the calculator
calc.send_keys(keys="96+4=")
```

## Versioning

This library uses semantic versioning, so, when a breaking change is done
a new major version is published, but beware that modules starting with an 
underscore `_` in `robocorp.windows` are not considered
part of the public API and should not be imported directly (so, only objects/classes
reached from the `robocorp.windows` namespace should be used -- if access to some
other method/class is needed, please create a feature request to address it).
