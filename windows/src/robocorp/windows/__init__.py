    Finds the first window matching the passed locator.

        search_depth: The search depth to find the window (by default == 1, meaning
            that only top-level windows will be found).

            until the given timeout (in **seconds**) elapses.

        raise_error: Do not raise and return `None` when this is set to `True` and such
            a window isn't found.
