        Print a tree of control elements.

        A Windows application structure can contain multilevel element structure.
        Understanding this structure is crucial for creating locators. (based on
        controls' details and their parent-child relationship)

        This keyword can be used to output logs of application's element structure.

        to create a locator to find the actual wanted element.

        Example:

            Print the top-level window elements:

        """Drag and drop the source element into target element.

        Args:
            source: Source element for the operation.
            target: Target element for the operation
            speed: The speed at which the mouse should move to make the drag
                (1 means regular speed, values bigger than 1 mean that
                the mouse should move faster and values lower than 1 mean that
                the mouse should move slower).
            hold_ctrl: Whether the `Ctrl` key should be hold while doing the
                drag and drop (on some cases this means that a copy of
                the item should be done).
            wait_time: Time to wait after drop, defaults to 1.0 second.

        Example:

            ```python
            # Get the opened explorer on the c:\\temp folder
            from robocorp import windows
            explorer1 = windows.find_window(r'name:C:\temp executable:explorer.exe')
            explorer2 = windows.find_window(r'name:C:\temp2 executable:explorer.exe')

            # copying a file, report.html, from source (File Explorer) window
            # into a target (File Explorer) Window
            report_html = explorer1.find('name:report.html type:ListItem')
            items_view = explorer2.find('name:"Items View"')
            explorer.drag_and_drop(report_html, items_view, hold_ctrl=True)
            ```
