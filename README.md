# Create, deploy and operate 🐍 Python AI Actions <br/> and 🤖 Automations anywhere.

Robocorp is the easiest way to extend the capabilities of AI agents, assistants and copilots with custom actions, written in Python. Create and deploy tools, skills, loaders and plugins that securely connects any AI Assistant platform to your data and applications.

# 🏃‍♂️ Quickstart

Install Robocorp Action Server:

```sh
# On macOS
brew install robocorp/tools/action-server

# On Linux or Windows
pip install robocorp-action-server
```

Bootstrap a new project from a template. You’ll be prompted for a name of the project:

```sh
action-server new
```

Navigate to the freshly created project folder and start the server:

```sh
cd my-project
action-server start --expose
```

Once that’s done, you’ll have an Action Server UI locally at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)), and a public internet-facing URL (something like _twently-cuddly-dinosaurs.robocorp.link_).

Head over to [Action Server docs](./action_server/docs) for more in detail documentation.

# What makes a Python function an ⚡️Action?

Three key things to know are:

- [conda.yaml file](https://github.com/robocorp/rcc/blob/master/docs/recipes.md#what-is-in-condayaml) that sets up your **Python environment and dependencies**
- [@action decorator](./actions/docs) that determines the **action entry point**
- [Type hints and docstring](./actions/docs) in Google-style to let AI agents know **what the Action does**.

## Add Action Server as a Toolkit to [🦜️🔗 LangChain](https://github.com/robocorp/langchain)

Robocorp Action Server comes with everything needed to connect it to your Langchain AI app project. The easiest way is to start with the template, provided in the Langchain project. Here’s how to do it:

```sh
# Install LangChain cli tool if not already there
pip install langchain-cli

# Use the Action Server template
langchain app new my-awesome-app --package action_server

# Start the template locally
langchain template serve
```

After running the steps above, you’ll have a Playground running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/playground where you can test your Actions with an Ai agent.

Want to build your own thing? Adding your own Robocorp AI Actions to a Langchain project is as easy as the code below. Just remember to change the URL of the Action Server if you are not running both the Action Server and Langchain app on the same machine.

```py
from langchain_robocorp import ActionServerToolkit

# Initialize Action Server Toolkit
toolkit = ActionServerToolkit(url="http://localhost:8080")
tools = toolkit.get_tools()
```

## Connect with OpenAI GPTs Actions

Once you have started the Action Server with `--expose` flag, you’ll get a URL available to the public, along with the authentication token. The relevant part of the output from the terminal looks like this, of course with your own details:

```sh
...
Uvicorn running on http://localhost:8080 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
🌍 URL: https://seventy-six-helpless-dragonflies.robocorp.link
🔑 Add following header api authorization header to run actions: { "Authorization": "Bearer xxx_xxx" }
```

Adding the Action Server hosted AI Action to your custom GPT is super simple, basically just navigate to “Actions” section of the GPT configuration, add the link to import the actions, and **Add Authentication** with **Authentication method** set to _“API key”_ and **Auth Type** to _“Bearer”_.

## Why use Robocorp AI Actions

- ❤️ “when it comes to automation, the Robocorp suite is the best one” _[/u/disturbing_nickname](https://old.reddit.com/r/rpa/comments/18qqspn/codeonly_rpa_pet_project/kez2jds/?context=3)_
- ❤️ “Robocorp seems to be a good player in this domain” _[/u/thankred](https://old.reddit.com/r/rpa/comments/18r5gne/recommendation_for_open_source_or_somewhat_less/kez6aw6/?context=3)_
- ❤️ “Since you know Python, check out Robocorp. Their product is crazy good.” _[/u/Uomis](https://old.reddit.com/r/rpa/comments/18n5sah/c/ke8qz2g?context=3)_

Robocorp stack is hands down the easiest way to give AI agents more capabilities. It’s an end-to-end stack supporting every type of connection between AI and your apps and data. You are in control where to run the code, but everything is built for easiness, security, and scalability.

- 🔐 **Isolate AI from your data/apps** - short explanation.
- 🏎️ **Develop Actions faster** - less boilerplate code, ready made libraries to tons of things.
- ♻️ **Code reusability** - easily reuse action code across various AI frameworks and apps
- 🕵️ **Full audit data lineage** - Know all that happened

Without env management hell?

Zero code deployment - no need to learn the tricks with AWS Lambdas or similar
